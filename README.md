# This mod alters existing pipes. You will need another mod to add new pipes.

## What?
NPT allows pipes to only connect to pipes of the same material, including underground pipes! Pipe weaving is now possible!
Please report any bugs here or on [github](https://github.com/protocol-1903/default-settings)



If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
